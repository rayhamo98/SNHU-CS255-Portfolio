# SNHU CS 255 Portfolio

Portfolio artifacts for CS 255: System Analysis and Design – DriverPass Project

## DriverPass Project Summary
The DriverPass project involved designing a cloud-based system for DriverPass LLC, a driver's education company focused on improving student pass rates on DMV tests. The client was the business owner (Liam) and the IT officer (Ian). They requested a secure, web-based platform that supports user registration, package purchases, online practice exams and learning materials, lesson scheduling with real-time availability, progress tracking, administrative management, and automated updates from the DMV.

## What I Did Particularly Well
I excelled at creating clear and detailed UML diagrams (use case, activity, sequence, and class diagrams) in the system design document. These diagrams effectively communicated the system's key interactions, workflows, and overall structure.

## Part I Would Revise
If I could revise one part, I would enhance the class diagram in the system design document. I would improve it by adding more specific attributes and methods to each class, along with clearer relationships (including multiplicity and inheritance where applicable), making it more comprehensive and ready for implementation.

## Interpreting User Needs and Importance
I interpreted the client’s needs by thoroughly reviewing the interview transcript, identifying core issues such as inefficient scheduling, outdated materials, and lack of liability protection, then translating those into functional and nonfunctional requirements, use cases, and design elements. Considering user needs is critical because a system that fails to address real-world problems for its users (students, instructors, and administrators) will not be adopted, resulting in project failure regardless of technical quality.

## My Approach to Designing Software
I approach software design by beginning with detailed requirements gathering, prioritizing user-centered functionality, and using UML modeling to iteratively refine system structure and behavior while embedding security and scalability from the start. In the future, I plan to incorporate agile-inspired feedback loops, advanced diagramming tools, blended object-oriented and process-oriented analysis, and early prototyping to build more robust, maintainable, and stakeholder-aligned systems.
